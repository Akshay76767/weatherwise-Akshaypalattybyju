Me: I need to build a WeatherWise application for my Python course. The assignment requires me to create a weather advisor that combines weather data access with conversational AI capabilities. Can you help me understand the project requirements and suggest the best approach?

AI: I'd be happy to help you build your WeatherWise application! Let me break down what you'll need to implement:

**Core Requirements:**
1. **Weather Data Component**: Retrieve weather data for user-specified locations, display current conditions and forecasts
2. **Natural Language Interface**: Allow users to ask weather questions in plain English, parse these questions, and provide natural-language responses
3. **User Experience**: Implement an intuitive menu system using pyinputplus with clear instructions and error handling
4. **Data Visualizations**: Create at least 2 different types of visualizations (e.g., temperature trends, precipitation chances)

**Technical Requirements:**
- Modular design with logical functions
- Core functions: get_weather_data(), parse_weather_question(), generate_weather_response(), create_temperature_visualisation(), create_precipitation_visualisation()
- Use either console-based menus with pyinputplus or interactive widgets
- Proper error handling and data validation

**Weather Data Source Options:**
1. **Foundation Option**: Use fetch-my-weather package (simplest)
2. **Standard Option**: Use wttr.in API directly (more control)
3. **Extension Option**: Implement OpenWeatherMap or similar (most advanced)

Which approach would you like to take? I'd recommend starting with the wttr.in API as it's free, reliable, and gives you good experience with API integration.

Me: I think I'll go with the wttr.in API approach. Can you help me implement the get_weather_data function first? I want to make sure I understand how to fetch and structure the weather data properly.

AI: Absolutely! Let me show you how to implement get_weather_data() using the wttr.in API. The wttr.in service provides weather data in JSON format when you append `?format=j1` to the URL.

Here's a robust implementation:

```python
import requests
import datetime
import time
from typing import Dict, Any

def get_weather_data(location: str, forecast_days: int = 5) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Retrieve weather data for a specified location from wttr.in (JSON).
    
    Args:
        location (str): City or location name
        forecast_days (int): Number of days to forecast (1-5)
        
    Returns:
        dict: Weather data including 'location', 'current', and 'forecast' (list)
    
    Raises:
        ValueError if location seems invalid or API fails.
    """
    if not location or not location.strip():
        raise ValueError("Location must be a non-empty string.")

    location_clean = location.strip()
    url = f"https://wttr.in/{requests.utils.requote_uri(location_clean)}?format=j1"
    
    try:
        resp = requests.get(url, timeout=10)
    except requests.RequestException as exc:
        raise ValueError(f"Network error while contacting weather service: {exc}")

    if resp.status_code != 200:
        raise ValueError(f"Weather service returned status {resp.status_code}")

    try:
        raw = resp.json()
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("Response from weather service was not JSON.")

    # Validate expected structure
    if "current_condition" not in raw or "weather" not in raw:
        raise ValueError("Unexpected weather data format from service.")

    # Limit forecast_days between 1 and 5
    fd = max(1, min(5, int(forecast_days)))

    # Build cleaned structure
    processed = {
        "location": location_clean,
        "fetched_at_utc": datetime.datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z",
        "current": raw.get("current_condition", [{}])[0],
        "forecast": raw.get("weather", [])[:fd],
        "raw": raw,  # keep raw in case we need extra fields
    }

    return processed
```

This implementation includes:
- Input validation
- Proper URL encoding for locations with spaces or special characters
- Network error handling
- JSON parsing with error handling
- Data structure validation
- Clean, organized output format

The function returns a dictionary with the location, timestamp, current conditions, and forecast data. This will make it easy for your other functions to work with the data.

Me: That looks good, but I'm concerned about making too many API calls during testing. Is there a way to add caching to avoid hitting the API repeatedly for the same location?

AI: Great thinking! Adding caching is an excellent practice and will make your application more efficient. Here's how you can implement a simple in-memory cache:

```python
import requests
import datetime
import time
from typing import Dict, Any

# Cache configuration
CACHE_TTL = 300  # 5 minutes in seconds
_weather_cache: Dict[str, Any] = {}

def get_weather_data(location: str, forecast_days: int = 5) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Retrieve weather data for a specified location from wttr.in (JSON).
    Includes caching to reduce API calls.
    
    Args:
        location (str): City or location name
        forecast_days (int): Number of days to forecast (1-5)
        
    Returns:
        dict: Weather data including 'location', 'current', and 'forecast' (list)
    
    Raises:
        ValueError if location seems invalid or API fails.
    """
    if not location or not location.strip():
        raise ValueError("Location must be a non-empty string.")

    location_clean = location.strip()
    loc_key = location_clean.lower()

    # Check cache first
    now = time.time()
    cached = _weather_cache.get(loc_key)
    if cached:
        ts, data = cached
        if now - ts < CACHE_TTL:
            return data

    # If not in cache or expired, fetch from API
    url = f"https://wttr.in/{requests.utils.requote_uri(location_clean)}?format=j1"
    
    try:
        resp = requests.get(url, timeout=10)
    except requests.RequestException as exc:
        raise ValueError(f"Network error while contacting weather service: {exc}")

    if resp.status_code != 200:
        raise ValueError(f"Weather service returned status {resp.status_code}")

    try:
        raw = resp.json()
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("Response from weather service was not JSON.")

    # Validate expected structure
    if "current_condition" not in raw or "weather" not in raw:
        raise ValueError("Unexpected weather data format from service.")

    # Limit forecast_days between 1 and 5
    fd = max(1, min(5, int(forecast_days)))

    # Build cleaned structure
    processed = {
        "location": location_clean,
        "fetched_at_utc": datetime.datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z",
        "current": raw.get("current_condition", [{}])[0],
        "forecast": raw.get("weather", [])[:fd],
        "raw": raw,  # keep raw in case we need extra fields
    }

    # Save to cache
    _weather_cache[loc_key] = (now, processed)
    return processed
```

The cache works by:
- Storing data with a timestamp in a global dictionary
- Checking if cached data exists and is still fresh (within 5 minutes)
- Only making API calls when necessary
- Using lowercase location names as keys for consistency

This will significantly reduce API calls during development and testing, and it's also good practice for production applications!

Me: Perfect! Now I understand the weather data retrieval. The caching approach is much better for testing. This gives me a solid foundation to build the rest of the application on.
