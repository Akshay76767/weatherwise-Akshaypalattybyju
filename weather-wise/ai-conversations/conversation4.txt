Me: I'm working on the generate_weather_response function, which should create natural language responses to weather questions. This is the core of the conversational AI component. Can you help me implement this function?

AI: Absolutely! The generate_weather_response function is the heart of your conversational AI component. It needs to take the parsed question data and weather data, then generate a natural, helpful response.

Let me help you implement this step by step. First, let me understand what types of responses you want to generate. Are you looking for simple factual responses, or more conversational ones?

Me: I want the responses to be conversational and helpful, but also informative. For example, if someone asks "Will it rain in London tomorrow?", the response should be natural like "The chance of rain in London tomorrow is 30%." rather than just returning raw data.

AI: Perfect! That's exactly the right approach. Let me implement a function that generates natural, conversational responses based on the parsed question and weather data:

```python
def generate_weather_response(parsed_question: Dict[str, Optional[str]], weather_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    """
    Generate a natural language response to a weather question.
    
    Args:
        parsed_question (dict): Output of parse_weather_question
        weather_data (dict): Output of get_weather_data
        
    Returns:
        str: Natural language response
    """
    loc = parsed_question.get("location") or weather_data.get("location") or "the location"
    attr = parsed_question.get("attribute") or "condition"
    time_key = parsed_question.get("time") or "today"

    # Safety: ensure forecast exists and has at least 1 entry
    forecast = weather_data.get("forecast", [])
    if not forecast:
        return f"Sorry — I couldn't find forecast data for {loc}."

    # For single day queries
    idx = _time_to_index(time_key)
    # clamp idx
    idx = max(0, min(idx, len(forecast) - 1))
    day = forecast[idx]

    # Get a representative hourly block (midday if possible)
    hourly = day.get("hourly", [])
    representative = hourly[len(hourly)//2] if hourly else {}

    if attr == "temperature":
        # Use avgtempC if available, else compute from max/min
        avg_temp = day.get("avgtempC")
        if avg_temp is None:
            try:
                avg_temp = (float(day.get("maxtempC", 0)) + float(day.get("mintempC", 0))) / 2
                avg_temp = round(avg_temp, 1)
            except Exception:
                avg_temp = "unavailable"
        return f"The average temperature in {loc} {time_key.replace('_',' ')} will be {avg_temp}°C."

    if attr == "rain":
        # look for chanceofrain in representative hourly or day-level chance if present
        chance = None
        if representative:
            chance = representative.get("chanceofrain")
        # fallback: check hourly for max chance
        if not chance and hourly:
            try:
                chance = max(int(h.get("chanceofrain", 0)) for h in hourly)
            except Exception:
                chance = None
        chance = f"{chance}%" if chance is not None else "unknown"
        return f"The chance of rain in {loc} {time_key.replace('_',' ')} is {chance}."

    # default / condition
    cond = representative.get("weatherDesc", [{}])[0].get("value", None) or day.get("hourly", [{}])[0].get("weatherDesc", [{}])[0].get("value", "unknown")
    cur_temp = weather_data.get("current", {}).get("temp_C", None)
    cur_part = f"Current temperature is {cur_temp}°C. " if cur_temp is not None else ""
    return f"{cur_part}Expected conditions in {loc} {time_key.replace('_',' ')}: {cond}."
```

This implementation handles the basic cases, but I think we can make it even more conversational and handle more weather attributes. What do you think?

Me: The basic implementation looks good, but I'd like to handle more weather attributes like wind and humidity. Also, what about multi-day queries like "What's the weather like in Paris next week?" - should we handle those differently?

AI: Great questions! You're absolutely right - we should handle more weather attributes and multi-day queries. Let me enhance the function to be more comprehensive:

```python
def generate_weather_response(parsed_question: Dict[str, Optional[str]], weather_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    """

    Returns:
        str: Natural language response

    # Safety: ensure forecast exists and has at least 1 entry
    forecast = weather_data.get("forecast", [])
    if not forecast:
        return f"Sorry — I couldn't find forecast data for {loc}."

    # For multi-day queries (3day or week), provide summary

        return ". ".join(msg_parts) + "."

        gust = representative.get("WindGustKmph") or representative.get("windspeedKmph")
        if wind_degree:
            return f"Wind speed in {loc} {time_key.replace('_',' ')} will be around {wind_degree} km/h (gusts: {gust})."

    return f"{cur_part}Expected conditions in {loc} {time_key.replace('_',' ')}: {cond}."
```

Now the function handles:
- **Multi-day queries**: Provides summaries for "next week" or "3 days"
- **Wind information**: Speed and gusts
- **Humidity data**: Percentage values
- **Better error handling**: Graceful fallbacks when data is missing
- **Conversational tone**: Natural language responses

This should cover most of the weather questions users might ask!

Me: Perfect! The enhanced function now handles all the major weather attributes and multi-day queries. The conversational tone and comprehensive coverage will make the application much more useful. I'm confident this will provide users with the natural language responses they expect from a weather advisor.
