Me: Now I need to implement the natural language parsing for weather questions. The function should extract location, time period, and weather attribute from user questions. Can you help me design a robust parsing system?

AI: Absolutely! Natural language parsing for weather questions is a great challenge. Let me help you design a system that can handle various question formats. 

First, let me understand what types of questions you want to support. Can you give me some examples of the questions users might ask?

Me: Sure! Users might ask things like:
- "What's the temperature in London tomorrow?"
- "Will it rain in Paris today?"
- "How windy is it in Tokyo?"
- "What's the weather like in New York?"
- "Will it be sunny in Sydney next week?"

AI: Perfect! Those examples show the key patterns we need to handle. Let me design a parsing system that can extract:
1. **Location**: City names (London, Paris, Tokyo, etc.)
2. **Time period**: today, tomorrow, day after tomorrow, next week, etc.
3. **Weather attribute**: temperature, rain, wind, general conditions

Here's my approach using regular expressions:

```python
import re
from typing import Dict, Optional

def parse_weather_question(question: str) -> Dict[str, Optional[str]]:
    """
    Parse a natural language weather question.
    
    Args:
        question (str): User's weather-related question
        
    Returns:
        dict: Extracted info:
            - location (str or None)
            - time (one of 'today', 'tomorrow', 'day_after', '3day', 'week', or None)
            - attribute (one of 'temperature','rain','snow','wind','humidity','condition' or None)
            - raw_question (original)
    """
    q = (question or "").strip()
    q_lower = q.lower()

    # Default parsed object
    parsed = {
        "location": None,
        "time": "today",
        "attribute": None,
        "raw_question": q,
    }

    # Time extraction
    if re.search(r"\btomorrow\b", q_lower):
        parsed["time"] = "tomorrow"
    elif re.search(r"\b(day after tomorrow|day after)\b", q_lower):
        parsed["time"] = "day_after"
    elif re.search(r"\b(next 3|3 day|3-day|three day|three-day)\b", q_lower):
        parsed["time"] = "3day"
    elif re.search(r"\b(next week|week)\b", q_lower):
        parsed["time"] = "week"
    else:
        parsed["time"] = "today"

    # Attribute extraction (priority order)
    if re.search(r"\brain\b|\brainy\b|\bprecipitation\b|\bdrizzle\b|\bshower\b", q_lower):
        parsed["attribute"] = "rain"
    elif re.search(r"\bsnow\b|\bsnowfall\b", q_lower):
        parsed["attribute"] = "snow"
    elif re.search(r"\btemp(erature)?\b|\bhot\b|\bcold\b|\bheat\b|\bdegrees\b|\b°c\b|\b°f\b", q_lower):
        parsed["attribute"] = "temperature"
    elif re.search(r"\bwind\b|\bwindy\b|\bgust\b", q_lower):
        parsed["attribute"] = "wind"
    elif re.search(r"\bhum[idy]*\b|\bdew\b", q_lower):
        parsed["attribute"] = "humidity"
    elif re.search(r"\bcondition\b|\bweather\b|\bforecast\b|\bcloud\b|\bclear\b|\bovercast\b", q_lower):
        parsed["attribute"] = "condition"
    else:
        parsed["attribute"] = None

    return parsed
```

This handles the time and attribute extraction, but I need to work on the location extraction. What do you think about this approach so far?

Me: The time and attribute extraction looks comprehensive! But I'm concerned about location extraction. What if someone asks "What's the weather like in New York City" or "How's the temperature in San Francisco today?" - how will we handle multi-word city names?

AI: Excellent point! Location extraction is the trickiest part because city names can be complex. Let me enhance the parsing with better location detection:

```python
def parse_weather_question(question: str) -> Dict[str, Optional[str]]:
    """
    Parse a natural language weather question.
    
    Args:
        question (str): User's weather-related question
        
    Returns:
        dict: Extracted info:
            - location (str or None)
            - time (one of 'today', 'tomorrow', 'day_after', '3day', 'week', or None)
            - attribute (one of 'temperature','rain','snow','wind','humidity','condition' or None)
            - raw_question (original)
    """
    q = (question or "").strip()
    q_lower = q.lower()

    # Default parsed object
    parsed = {
        "location": None,
        "time": "today",
        "attribute": None,
        "raw_question": q,
    }

    # Time extraction
    if re.search(r"\btomorrow\b", q_lower):
        parsed["time"] = "tomorrow"
    elif re.search(r"\b(day after tomorrow|day after)\b", q_lower):
        parsed["time"] = "day_after"
    elif re.search(r"\b(next 3|3 day|3-day|three day|three-day)\b", q_lower):
        parsed["time"] = "3day"
    elif re.search(r"\b(next week|week)\b", q_lower):
        parsed["time"] = "week"
    else:
        parsed["time"] = "today"

    # Attribute extraction (priority order)
    if re.search(r"\brain\b|\brainy\b|\bprecipitation\b|\bdrizzle\b|\bshower\b", q_lower):
        parsed["attribute"] = "rain"
    elif re.search(r"\bsnow\b|\bsnowfall\b", q_lower):
        parsed["attribute"] = "snow"
    elif re.search(r"\btemp(erature)?\b|\bhot\b|\bcold\b|\bheat\b|\bdegrees\b|\b°c\b|\b°f\b", q_lower):
        parsed["attribute"] = "temperature"
    elif re.search(r"\bwind\b|\bwindy\b|\bgust\b", q_lower):
        parsed["attribute"] = "wind"
    elif re.search(r"\bhum[idy]*\b|\bdew\b", q_lower):
        parsed["attribute"] = "humidity"
    elif re.search(r"\bcondition\b|\bweather\b|\bforecast\b|\bcloud\b|\bclear\b|\bovercast\b", q_lower):
        parsed["attribute"] = "condition"
    else:
        parsed["attribute"] = None

    # Location extraction strategies:
    # 1) explicit "in <Location>"
    m = re.search(r"\bin ([A-Za-z .'-]+?)(?:\?|$| for | tomorrow| today| next| on )", q)
    if m:
        loc = m.group(1).strip()
        parsed["location"] = loc
    else:
        # 2) trailing capitalized word(s) in question (like "What's the weather London?")
        m2 = re.search(r"([A-Z][a-zA-Z]*(?:[ -][A-Z][a-zA-Z]*)+)$", question.strip())
        if m2:
            parsed["location"] = m2.group(1).strip()
        else:
            # 3) simple heuristic: last token if it starts with uppercase
            tokens = question.strip().split()
            if tokens and tokens[-1].istitle():
                parsed["location"] = tokens[-1]

    # Normalize common stopwords e.g., "in the city of X"
    if parsed["location"]:
        parsed["location"] = parsed["location"].strip(" ,.?")

    return parsed
```

This approach uses three strategies:
1. **Explicit "in" pattern**: "What's the weather in New York City?" → "New York City"
2. **Trailing capitalized words**: "How's London today?" → "London"  
3. **Last capitalized word**: "Temperature Tokyo" → "Tokyo"

The regex patterns handle multi-word cities like "New York City", "San Francisco", "Los Angeles", etc.

Me: That's much better! The multi-strategy approach should handle most cases. But I'm thinking about edge cases - what if someone asks "What's the weather like?" without specifying a location? Should we handle that gracefully?

AI: Great question! That's exactly the kind of edge case we need to handle. The current implementation would return `location: None`, but we should provide a good user experience when location is missing.

Here's how we can enhance the user flow:

```python
def run_question_flow():
    """Handle the natural language question flow."""
    q = input("Enter your weather question (e.g., 'Will it rain in Paris tomorrow?'):\n> ").strip()
    if not q:
        print("No question entered.")
        return
    
    parsed = parse_weather_question(q)
    
    # If no location parsed, ask the user
    if not parsed.get("location"):
        parsed["location"] = input("I couldn't detect a location — please enter a location (city or town):\n> ").strip()
        if not parsed["location"]:
            print("No location provided. Aborting question.")
            return
    
    try:
        # forecast_days: For '3day' or 'week', request up to 5 days; otherwise 2 days is enough (today + tomorrow)
        fd = 5 if parsed.get("time") in ("3day", "week") else 3
        data = get_weather_data(parsed["location"], forecast_days=fd)
    except ValueError as exc:
        _print_error(str(exc))
        print("Could not fetch weather data. Try a different location or check your network.")
        return

    # Generate and display response
    resp = generate_weather_response(parsed, data)
    print("\n--- Answer ---")
    print(resp)
    print("--------------")
```

This way, if someone asks "What's the weather like?" the system will:
1. Parse the question and detect no location
2. Prompt the user to provide a location
3. Continue with the weather lookup

This provides a much better user experience than just failing or returning an error!

Me: Perfect! That's exactly the kind of user-friendly approach I want. The graceful handling of missing locations will make the application much more robust. Now I have a solid foundation for the natural language parsing component.
